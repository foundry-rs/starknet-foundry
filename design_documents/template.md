## Rationale of the solution 
Provide use cases of the feature and general motivation why it is worth implementing/was implemented. You can also include some 
existing solutions.

## User perspective description of the solution
Provide only if documentation doesn't already exist and if the feature is user-facing. 
Provide an overview of the feature API from the user perspective. Consider it a draft documentation which you can later reuse as documentation.

## Technical overview of the solution
Provide a rough description of the feature implementation. Keep it high level. Try to include your mental model if possible.
Try to include motivation behind non-obvious technical decisions. This is important so we don't have to rethink details and motivations it every time.


## Implementation plan
Optional - provide only if feature is not implemented and you have some steps in mind which you will take. Keep it high level!
