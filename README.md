Blazingly fast toolkit for developing Starknet contracts designed & developed by
ex [Protostar](https://github.com/software-mansion/protostar) team from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com) based
on native [Cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo) test runner
and [Blockifier](https://github.com/starkware-libs/blockifier), written in Rust 🦀.

![Example run](.github/images/demo.gif)

Starknet Foundry, like its [Ethereum counterpart](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), consists of different modules

- [`snforge`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/tree/master/crates/forge): Starknet testing
  framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools but for Starknet).
- [`sncast`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/tree/master/crates/sncast): All-in-one tool for
  interacting with Starknet smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.

## FAQ

> Why do I have to install Rust?

`snforge` relies on Scarb's [_procedural macros_](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/issues/2299) to create
`snforge_scarb_plugin` which is a part of `snforge_std`.
This plugin is required for `snforge` test to work.
Currently, _procedural macros_ require Rust installation to function.
This will be changed in the upcoming versions of Scarb.
