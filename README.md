Starknet Foundry, like its [Ethereum counterpart](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), consists of different modules

- [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/tree/master/starknet-foundry/crates/forge): Starknet testing
  framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools but for Starknet).
- [Cast](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/tree/master/starknet-foundry/crates/cast): All-in-one tool for
  interacting with Starknet smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.

## Features

- Fast testing framework `Forge` written in Rust
- High-quality dependency management using [scarb](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb)
- Intuitive interactions and deployment of Starknet contracts

## Coming Soon ðŸ‘€

Starknet Foundry is under active development! Expect a lot of new features to appear soon! ðŸ”¥

- [ ] Cheatcodes
- [ ] Performance improvements
- [ ] State forking
- [ ] Advanced debugging utilities
- [ ] Creating and deploying new accounts
- [ ] Deployment scripts written in Cairo

## Performance

![Starknet test framework speed comparison](./benchmarks/plot.png)

Forge achieves performance comparable to the Cairo Test Runner with greatly improved user experience. All that is possible on just a single thread and multithreading is well on it's way!
