Blazingly fast toolkit for developing Starknet contracts designed & developed by
ex [Protostar](https://github.com/software-mansion/protostar) team from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com) based
on native [Cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo) test runner
and [Blockifier](https://github.com/starkware-libs/blockifier), written in Rust ü¶Ä.

![Example run](.github/images/demo-gif/demo.gif)

Starknet Foundry, like its [Ethereum counterpart](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), consists of different modules

- [`snforge`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/tree/master/crates/forge): Starknet testing
  framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools but for Starknet).
- [`sncast`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/tree/master/crates/sncast): All-in-one tool for
  interacting with Starknet smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.

## Installation

To install Starknet Foundry, first install `snfoundryup` by running:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/master/scripts/install.sh | sh

```shell
snfoundryup
```

You can also specify a version you wish to install:
