# How Contracts Are Collected

For the [`declare`](../../appendix/snforge-library/declare.md) to work, snforge must collect and call build on
contracts in the package. By default, if using Scarb version >= 2.8.3, snforge will combine test
collection and contract collection steps.

When running `snforge test`, snforge will, under the hood, call the `scarb build --test` command. This command builds
all the test and contracts along them. Snforge collects these contracts and makes them available for declaring in tests.

Contracts are collected from both `src` and `tests` directory, including modules marked with `#[cfg(test)]`.
Internally, snforge collects contracts from all `[[test]]` targets compiled by Scarb.
You can read more about that in [test collection](../test-collection.md) documentation.

## Collection Order

When multiple `[[test]]` targets are present, snforge will first try to collect contracts from `integration` `test-type`
target. If `integration` is not present, snforge will first collect contracts from the first encountered `[[test]]`
target.

After collecting from initial `[[test]]` target, snforge will collect contracts from any other encountered targets.
No specific order of collection is guaranteed.

> 📝 **Note**
>
> If multiple contracts with the same name are present, snforge will use the first encountered implementation and will
> not collect others.

## Using External Contracts in Tests

To use contract from dependencies in tests, `Scarb.toml` must be updated to include these contracts under
`[[target.starknet-contract]]`.

```toml
[[target.starknet-contract]]
build-external-contracts = ["path::to::Contract1", "other::path::to::Contract2"]
```

For more information about `build-external-contracts`,
see [Scarb documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/extensions/starknet/contract-target.html#compiling-external-contracts).
