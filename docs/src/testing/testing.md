# Writing Tests

`snforge` lets you test standalone functions from your smart contracts. This technique is referred to as unit testing. You
should write as many unit tests as possible as these are faster than integration tests.

## Writing Your First Test

First, add the following code to the `src/lib.cairo` file:

```rust
fn sum(a: felt252, b: felt252) -> felt252 {
    return a + b;
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::sum;

    #[test]
    fn test_sum() {
        assert(sum(2, 3) == 5, 'sum incorrect');
    }
}
```

It is a common practice to keep your unit tests in the same file as the tested code. 
Keep in mind that all tests in `src` folder have to be in a module annotated with `#[cfg(test)]`.
When it comes to integration tests, you can keep them in separate files in the `tests` directory.
You can find a detailed explanation of how `snforge` collects tests [here](test-collection.md).

Now run `snforge` using a command:

```shell
$ snforge test
Collected 1 test(s) from package_name package
Running 1 test(s) from src/
[PASS] package_name::tests::test_sum
Tests: 1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 ignored, 0 filtered out
```

## Failing Tests

If your code panics, the test is considered failed. Here's an example of a failing test.

```rust
fn panicking_function() {
    let mut data = array![];
    data.append('aaa');
    panic(data)
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::panicking_function;
    
    #[test]
    fn failing() {
        panicking_function();
        assert(2 == 2, '2 == 2');
    }
}
```

```shell
$ snforge test
Collected 1 test(s) from package_name package
Running 1 test(s) from src/
[FAIL] package_name::tests::failing

Failure data:
    0x616161 ('aaa')

Tests: 0 passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped, 0 ignored, 0 filtered out

Failures:
    package_name::tests::failing
```

## Expected Failures

Sometimes you want to mark a test as expected to fail. This is useful when you want to verify that an action fails as
expected.

To mark a test as expected to fail, use the `#[should_panic]` attribute.

You can specify the expected failure message in three ways:

1. **With ByteArray**:
   ```rust
    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected: "This will panic")]
    fn should_panic_exact() {
        panic!("This will panic");
    }

    // here the expected message is a substring of the actual message
    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected: "will panic")]
    fn should_panic_expected_is_substring() {
        panic!("This will panic");
    }
   ```
   With this format, the expected error message needs to be a substring of the actual error message. This is particularly useful when the error message includes dynamic data such as a hash or address.

2. **With felt**
   ```rust
    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected: 'panic message')]
    fn should_panic_felt_matching() {
       assert(1 != 1, 'panic message');
    }
   ```

3. **With tuple of felts**:
   ```rust
    use core::panic_with_felt252;
   
    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected: ('panic message', ))]
    fn should_panic_check_data() {
        panic_with_felt252('panic message');
    }

    // works for multiple messages
    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected: ('panic message', 'second message',))]
    fn should_panic_multiple_messages() {
        let mut arr = ArrayTrait::new();
        arr.append('panic message');
        arr.append('second message');
        panic(arr);
    }
   ```
   

```shell
$ snforge test
Collected 1 test(s) from package_name package
Running 1 test(s) from src/
Running 0 test(s) from tests/
[PASS] package_name::tests::should_panic_check_data
Tests: 1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 ignored, 0 filtered out
```

## Ignoring Tests

Sometimes you may have tests that you want to exclude during most runs of `snforge test`.
You can achieve it using `#[ignore]` - tests marked with this attribute will be skipped by default.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    #[ignore]
    fn ignored_test() {
        // test code
    }
}
```

```shell
$ snforge test
Collected 1 test(s) from package_name package
Running 1 test(s) from src/
Running 0 test(s) from tests/
[IGNORE] package_name::tests::ignored_test
Tests: 0 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 1 ignored, 0 filtered out
```

To run only tests marked with the  `#[ignore]` attribute use `snforge test --ignored`. 
To run all tests regardless of the `#[ignore]` attribute use `snforge test --include-ignored`.
