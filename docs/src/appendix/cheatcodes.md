> ℹ️ **Info**
> To use cheatcodes you need to add `snforge_std` package as a development dependency in
> your [`Scarb.toml`](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/guides/dependencies.html#development-dependencies)
> using appropriate release tag.
>
> ```toml
> [dev-dependencies]
> snforge_std = { git = "https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry.git", tag = "v0.12.0" }
> ```
