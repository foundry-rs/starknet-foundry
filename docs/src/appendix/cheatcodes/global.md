# Cheating Globally

Cheatcodes which have `_global` suffix allow to change specific properties in blockchain state for all targets and for indefinite time span. Therefore, you don't pass the target address, nor the span.

See the [Cheating Addresses Globally](../../testing/using-cheatcodes.md#cheating-addresses-globally) example.
