# `mock`

Cheatcodes mocking calls to a function:

* [`mock_calls`](./mock_calls.md) - mocks a number of contract calls to a function of a contract at the given address
* [`start_mock_call`](./start_mock_call.md) - mocks contract calls to a function of a contract at the given address until [`stop_mock_call`](./stop_mock_call.md) is called
* [`stop_mock_call`](./stop_mock_call.md) - cancels the [`mock_calls`](./mock_calls.md) / [`start_mock_call`](./start_mock_call.md) for the given function of a contract at the given address
