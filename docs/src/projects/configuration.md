# Project Configuration

## `snforge`

### Configuring `snforge` Settings in `Scarb.toml`

It is possible to configure `snforge` for all test runs through `Scarb.toml`.
Instead of passing arguments in the command line, set them directly in the file.

```toml
# ...
[tool.snforge]
exit_first = true
# ...
```

`snforge` automatically looks for `Scarb.toml` in the directory you are running the tests in or in any of its parents.

## `sncast`

### Defining Profiles in `snfoundry.toml`

To be able to work with the network, you need to supply `sncast` with a few parameters —
namely the rpc node url and an account name that should be used to interact with it.
This can be done
by either supplying `sncast` with those parameters directly [see more detailed CLI description,](../appendix/sncast.md)
or you can put them into `snfoundry.toml` file:

```toml
# ...
[sncast.myprofile]
account = "user"
accounts-file = "~/my_accounts.json"
url = "http://127.0.0.1:5050/rpc"
# ...
```

With `snfoundry.toml` configured this way, we can just pass `--profile myprofile` argument to make sure `sncast` uses parameters
defined in the profile.

> 📝 **Note**
> `snfoundry.toml` file has to be present in current or any of the parent directories.

> 📝 **Note**
> If there is a profile with the same name in Scarb.toml, scarb will use this profile. If not, scarb will default to using the dev profile.
> (This applies only to subcommands using scarb - namely `declare` and `script`).

> 💡 **Info**
> Not all parameters have to be present in the configuration - you can choose to include only some of them and supply
> the rest of them using CLI flags. You can also override parameters from the configuration using CLI flags.

```shell
$ sncast --profile myprofile \
    call \
    --contract-address 0x0589a8b8bf819b7820cb699ea1f6c409bc012c9b9160106ddc3dacd6a89653cf \
    --function get_balance \
    --block-id latest
```

### Multiple Profiles

You can have multiple profiles defined in the `snfoundry.toml`.

### Default Profile

There is also an option to set up a default profile, which can be utilized without the need to specify a `--profile`. Here's an example:

```toml
# ...
[sncast.default]
account = "user123"
accounts-file = "~/my_accounts.json"
url = "http://127.0.0.1:5050/rpc"
# ...
```

With this, there's no need to include the `--profile` argument when using `sncast`.

```shell
$ sncast call \
    --contract-address 0x0589a8b8bf819b7820cb699ea1f6c409bc012c9b9160106ddc3dacd6a89653cf \
    --function get_balance \
    --block-id latest
```

### Global Configuration

Global configuration file is a [`snfoundry.toml`](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/appendix/snfoundry-toml.html), 
which is a common storage for configurations to apply to multiple projects across various directories.
This file is stored in a predefined location and is used to store profiles that can be used from any location on your computer.

#### Interaction Between Local and Global Profiles

Global config can be overridden by a local config.

If both local and global profiles with the same name are present, local profile will be combined with global profile. For any setting defined in both profiles, the local setting will take precedence. For settings not defined in the local profile, values from the corresponding global profile will be used, or if not defined, values from the global default profile will be used instead.

This same behavior applies for [default profiles](#default-profile) as well. A local default profile will override a global default profile.

> 📝 **Note**
> Remember that arguments passed in the CLI have the highest priority and will always override the configuration file settings.


#### Global Configuration File Location
The global configuration is stored in a specific location depending on the operating system:

- macOS/Linux : The global configuration file is located at `$HOME/.config/starknet-foundry/snfoundry.toml`
- Windows : The file can be found at `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\starknet-foundry\snfoundry.toml`

> 📝 **Note**
> If missing, global configuration file will be created automatically on running any `sncast` command for the first time.

### Config Interaction Example

```
root/
├── .config/
│   └── starknet-foundry/
│       └── snfoundry.toml -> A
└── /../../
        └── projects/
            ├── snfoundry.toml -> B
            └── cairo-projects/
                └── opus-magnum/
```

**Glossary:**

- **A:** Global configuration file containing the profiles [`default`](#default-profile) and [`testnet`](#defining-profiles-in-snfoundrytoml).
- **B:** Local configuration file containing the profiles `default` and `mainnet`.

In any directory in the file system, a user can run the `sncast` command using the `default` and `testnet` profiles, 
because they are defined in global config (file A). 

If no profiles are explicitly specified, the `default` profile from the global configuration file will be used.

When running `sncast` from the `opus-magnum` directory, there is a configuration file in the parent directory (file B). 
This setup allows for the use of the following profiles: `default`, `testnet`, and `mainnet`. If the `mainnet` profile is specified, 
the configuration from the local file will be used to override the global `default` profile, as the `mainnet` profile does not exist in the global configuration.

## Environmental Variables

Programmers can use environmental variables in both `Scarb.toml::tool::snforge` and in `snfoundry.toml`. To use an environmental variable as a value, use its name prefixed with `$`. 
This might be useful, for example, to hide node urls in the public repositories. 
As an example:

```toml
# ...
[sncast.default]
account = "my_account"
accounts-file = "~/my_accounts.json"
url = "$NODE_URL"
# ...
```

Variable values are automatically resolved to numbers and booleans (strings `true`, `false`) where possible.
