# `sncast` 101

This page showcases the standard usage of various `sncast` commands.
For more in-depth explanation, please follow other guides from "sncast Overview".

## Create and Deploy an Account

First, create an account contract ready for deployment.
This generates the account details but doesn't put it on the network yet.

<!-- { "ignored": true } -->
```shell
$ sncast account create \
  --name my_account \
  --network sepolia
```

<details>
<summary>Output:</summary>

```shell
command: account create
add_profile: --add-profile flag was not set. No profile added to snfoundry.toml
address: 0x[..]
max_fee: [..]
message: Account successfully created. Prefund generated address with at least <max_fee> STRK tokens. It is good to send more in the case of higher demand.

After prefunding the address, run:
sncast account deploy --network sepolia --name my_account
```

</details>

> 📝 **Note**
> The `address` in the output has been redacted to avoid confusion.
> It will be visible when running the command locally.

After creating an account, send enough STRK tokens to the address to cover the price of the
account creation.
At least `max_fee` amount of fri (1 STRK = 10<sup>18</sup> fri) should be sent.

> 💡 **Tip**
> On Sepolia, [this free faucet](https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/) can be used to fund the account.


Then, deploy the account using the command that was provided in output, below `After prefunding the address, run`:

<!-- { "ignored": true } -->
```shell
$ sncast account deploy \
  --network sepolia
  --name my_account
```

<details>
<summary>Output:</summary>

```shell
command: account deploy
transaction_hash: 0x[..]

> 💡 **Tip**
> Existing accounts can be imported to `sncast` as well. See [Importing Accounts](./account-import.md) for more
> information.

## Calling a Contract

Calling a contract doesn't require an account

```shell
$ sncast call \
  --contract-address 0x04718f5a0fc34cc1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d \
  --function decimals \
  --network sepolia
```

<details>
<summary>Output:</summary>

```shell
command: call
response: [0x12]
```

</details>

## Sending a Transaction

To send a transaction, invoke a contract.

> 📝 **Note**
> `--account` argument must be passed before invoke (subcommand).
> This is the same for other commands that send transactions as well.

```shell
$ sncast \
  --account my_account \
  invoke \
  --contract-address 0x04718f5a0fc34cc1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d \
  --function transfer \
  --arguments '0x123, 100' \
  --network sepolia
```

> 💡 **Tip**
> `--arguments` flag supports various kinds of Cairo types including
> structs `--arguments 'MyStruct { a: 1, b: 2 }` and enums `--arguments MyEnum::Variant1`.
>
> See [Calldata Transformation](./calldata-transformation.md) for more details.

<details>
<summary>Output:</summary>

```shell
command: invoke
transaction_hash: 0x[..]

To see invocation details, visit:
transaction: https://sepolia.starkscan.co/tx/0x[..]
```

## Declare a Contract

`sncast` uses `scarb` to build contracts and can find contracts by their names (part after `mod` for
`#[starknet::contract]`).
To declare a contract, simply pass it name to `sncast`.

> 💡 **Tip**
> There is no need to run `scarb build` before declaration.
> `sncast` will do that automatically

Create a project

```shell
snforge new my_project
```

From inside the `my_project` directory run

<!-- { "ignored": true, "package_name": "hello_starknet" }  -->
```shell
$ sncast \
  --account my_account \
  declare \
  --contract-name HelloStarknet \
  --network sepolia
```

<details>
<summary>Output:</summary>

```shell
command: declare
class_hash: 0x[..]
transaction_hash: 0x[..]

To see declaration details, visit:
class: https://sepolia.starkscan.co/class/0x[..]
transaction: https://sepolia.starkscan.co/tx/0x[..]
```

</details>

## Deploy a Contract

Provide a class hash of your contract obtained from declaring it. It's the part after `class_hash:`.

<!-- { "ignored": true }  -->
```shell
$ sncast \
  --account my_account \
  deploy \
  --class-hash 0x06813150c8b6256546fe2324b49f85021a207b6a383fc207d587f4bfacec00d8 \
  --network sepolia
```

<details>
<summary>Output:</summary>

```shell
command: deploy
contract_address: 0x[..]
transaction_hash: 0x[..]

To see deployment details, visit:
contract: https://sepolia.starkscan.co/contract/0x[..]
transaction: https://sepolia.starkscan.co/tx/0x[..]
```
