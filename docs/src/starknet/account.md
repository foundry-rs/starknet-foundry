# Creating And Deploying Accounts

Account is required to perform interactions with Starknet (only calls can be done without it). Starknet Foundry `sncast` supports
entire account management flow with the `sncast account create` and `sncast account deploy` commands.

Difference between those two commands is that the first one creates account information (private key, address and more)
and the second one deploys it to the network. After deployment, account can be used to interact with Starknet.

To remove an account from the accounts file, you can use  `sncast account delete`. Please note this only removes the account information stored locally - this will not remove the account from Starknet.

> ðŸ’¡ **Info**
> Currently, only OpenZeppelin account creation is supported.

## Examples

### General Example

Do the following to start interacting with the Starknet:

- create account with the `sncast account create` command

    ```shell
    $ sncast \
      --url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
      account create \
      --name some-name
      
    Account successfully created. Prefund generated address with at least 432300000000 tokens. It is good to send more in the case of higher demand, max_fee * 2 = 864600000000
    command: account create
    max_fee: 0x64a7168300
    address: 0x7a949e83b243068d0cbedd8d5b8b32fafea66c54de23c40e68b126b5c845b61
    ```

    You can also pass common `--accounts-file` argument with a path to (existing or not existing) file where you want to save account info.
    
    For a detailed CLI description, see [account create command reference](../appendix/sncast/account/create.md).


- prefund generated address with tokens
  
    You can do it both by sending tokens from another starknet account or by bridging them with [StarkGate](https://starkgate.starknet.io/).


- deploy account with the `sncast account deploy` command

    ```shell
    $ sncast \
      --url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
      account deploy
      --name some-name \
      --max-fee 9999999999999
    
    command: account deploy
    transaction_hash: 0x20b20896ce63371ef015d66b4dd89bf18c5510a840b4a85a43a983caa6e2579
    ```
  
    Note that you don't have to pass `url`, `accounts-file` and `network` parameters if `add-profile` flag
    was set in the `account create` command. Just pass `profile` argument with the account name.
    
    For a detailed CLI description, see [account deploy command reference](../appendix/sncast/account/deploy.md).


### `account create` With Salt Argument

Salt will not be randomly generated if it's specified with `--salt`.

```shell
$ sncast \
    account create \
    --name some-name \
    --salt 0x1
  
Account successfully created. Prefund generated address with at least 432300000000 tokens. It is good to send more in the case of higher demand, max_fee * 2 = 864600000000
command: account create
max_fee: 0x64a7168300
address: 0x7a949e83b243068d0cbedd8d5b8b32fafea66c54de23c40e68b126b5c845b61
```

### `account delete`

Delete an account from `accounts-file` and its associated Scarb profile.

```shell
$ sncast \
    --accounts-file my-account-file.json \
    account delete \
    --name some-name \
    --network alpha-sepolia
  
Do you want to remove account some-name from network alpha-sepolia? (Y/n)
Y
command: account delete
result: Account successfully removed
```

For a detailed CLI description, see [account delete command reference](../appendix/sncast/account/delete.md).

### Custom Account Contract

By default, `sncast` creates/deploys an account using [openzeppelin contract's class hash](https://starkscan.co/class/0x058d97f7d76e78f44905cc30cb65b91ea49a4b908a76703c54197bca90f81773).
It is possible to create an account using custom openzeppelin contract declared to starknet. This can be achieved
with `--class-hash` flag:

```shell
$ sncast \
    account create \
    --name some-name \
    --class-hash 0x058d97f7d76e78f44905cc30cb65b91ea49a4b908a76703c54197bca90f81773

Account successfully created. Prefund generated address with at least 432300000000 tokens. It is good to send more in the case of higher demand, max_fee * 2 = 864600000000
command: account create
max_fee: 0x64a7168300
address: 0x7a949e83b243068d0cbedd8d5b8b32fafea66c54de23c40e68b126b5c845b61

$ sncast \
  account deploy \
  --name some-name \
  --max-fee 864600000000

command: account deploy
transaction_hash: 0x20b20896ce63371ef015d66b4dd89bf18c5510a840b4a85a43a983caa6e2579
```

### Using Keystore and Starkli Account

Accounts created and deployed with [starkli](https://book.starkli.rs/accounts#accounts) can be used by specifying the [`--keystore` argument](../appendix/sncast/common.md#--keystore--k-path_to_keystore_file).

> ðŸ’¡ **Info**
> When passing the `--keystore` argument, `--account` argument must be a path to the starkli account JSON file.

```shell
$ sncast \
    --url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
    --keystore path/to/keystore.json \
    --account path/to/account.json  \
    declare \
    --contract-name my_contract
```

#### Importing an Account

To import an account into the file holding the accounts info (`~/.starknet_accounts/starknet_open_zeppelin_accounts.json` by default), use the `account add` command.

```shell
$ sncast \
    --url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
    account add \
    --name my_imported_account \
    --address 0x1 \
    --private-key 0x2 \
    --class-hash 0x3 \
```

For a detailed CLI description, see [account add command reference](../appendix/sncast/account/add.md).

### Creating an Account With Starkli-Style Keystore

It is possible to create an openzeppelin account with keystore in a similar way [starkli](https://book.starkli.rs/accounts#accounts) does.

```shell
$ sncast \
    --url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
    --keystore my_key.json \
    --account my_account.json \
    account create
```

The command above will generate a keystore file containing the private key, as well as an account file containing the openzeppelin account info that can later be used with starkli.
