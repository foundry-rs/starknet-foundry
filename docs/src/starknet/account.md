# Creating And Deploying Accounts

Account is required to perform interactions with Starknet (only calls can be done without it). Starknet Foundry `sncast` supports
entire account management flow with the `sncast account create` and `sncast account deploy` commands.

Difference between those two commands is that the first one creates account information (private key, address and more)
and the second one deploys it to the network. After deployment, account can be used to interact with Starknet.

To remove an account from the accounts file, you can use  `sncast account delete`. Please note this only removes the account information stored locally - this will not remove the account from Starknet.

## Examples

### General Example

Do the following to start interacting with the Starknet:

- create account with the `sncast account create` command

    ```shell
    $ sncast \
      account create \
	  --url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
      --name some-name
      
    Account successfully created. Prefund generated address with at least 432300000000 tokens. It is good to send more in the case of higher demand, max_fee * 2 = 864600000000
    command: account create
    max_fee: 0x64a7168300
    address: 0x7a949e83b243068d0cbedd8d5b8b32fafea66c54de23c40e68b126b5c845b61
    ```

    You can also pass common `--accounts-file` argument with a path to (existing or not existing) file where you want to save account info.
    
    For a detailed CLI description, see [account create command reference](../appendix/sncast/account/create.md).


- prefund generated address with tokens

	To deploy an account in the next step, you need to prefund it with either STRK or ETH tokens (read more about them [here](https://docs.starknet.io/architecture-and-concepts/economics-of-starknet/)).
    You can do it both by sending tokens from another starknet account or by bridging them with [StarkGate](https://starkgate.starknet.io/).

 >ðŸ’¡ **Info**
> When deploying on a Sepolia test network, you can also fund your account with artificial tokens via the [Starknet Faucet](https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app)

- deploy account with the `sncast account deploy` command

    ```shell
    $ sncast \
      account deploy
	  --url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
      --name some-name \
      --fee-token strk \
      --max-fee 9999999999999
    
    command: account deploy
    transaction_hash: 0x20b20896ce63371ef015d66b4dd89bf18c5510a840b4a85a43a983caa6e2579
    ```
  
    Note that you don't have to pass `url`, `accounts-file` and `network` parameters if `add-profile` flag
    was set in the `account create` command. Just pass `profile` argument with the account name.
    
    For a detailed CLI description, see [account deploy command reference](../appendix/sncast/account/deploy.md).

> ðŸ’¡ **Info**
> You can also choose to pay in Ether by setting `--fee-token` to `eth`.

### `account create` With Salt Argument

Salt will not be randomly generated if it's specified with `--salt`.

```shell
$ sncast \
    account create \
    --name some-name \
    --salt 0x1
  
Account successfully created. Prefund generated address with at least 432300000000 tokens. It is good to send more in the case of higher demand, max_fee * 2 = 864600000000
command: account create
max_fee: 0x64a7168300
address: 0x7a949e83b243068d0cbedd8d5b8b32fafea66c54de23c40e68b126b5c845b61
```

### `account delete`

Delete an account from `accounts-file` and its associated Scarb profile.

```shell
$ sncast \
    --accounts-file my-account-file.json \
    account delete \
    --name some-name \
    --network alpha-sepolia
  
Do you want to remove account some-name from network alpha-sepolia? (Y/n)
Y
command: account delete
result: Account successfully removed
```

For a detailed CLI description, see [account delete command reference](../appendix/sncast/account/delete.md).

### `account list`

List all accounts saved in `accounts file`, grouped based on the networks they are defined on.

```shell
$ sncast --accounts-file my-account-file.json account list
Available accounts (at <current-directory>/my-account-file.json):
- user0
public key: 0x2f91ed13f8f0f7d39b942c80bfcd3d0967809d99e0cc083606cbe59033d2b39
network: alpha-sepolia
address: 0x4f5f24ceaae64434fa2bc2befd08976b51cf8f6a5d8257f7ec3616f61de263a
type: OpenZeppelin
deployed: false
legacy: false

- user1
[...]

To show private keys too, run with --display-private-keys or -p

$ sncast --accounts-file my-account-file.json account list --display-private-keys
Available accounts (at <current-directory>/my-account-file.json):
- user0
private key: 0x1e9038bdc68ce1d27d54205256988e85
public key: 0x2f91ed13f8f0f7d39b942c80bfcd3d0967809d99e0cc083606cbe59033d2b39
network: alpha-sepolia
address: 0x4f5f24ceaae64434fa2bc2befd08976b51cf8f6a5d8257f7ec3616f61de263a
type: OpenZeppelin
deployed: false
legacy: false

- user1
[...]
```

### Custom Account Contract

By default, `sncast` creates/deploys an account using [OpenZeppelin's account contract class hash](https://starkscan.co/class/0x00e2eb8f5672af4e6a4e8a8f1b44989685e668489b0a25437733756c5a34a1d6).
It is possible to create an account using custom openzeppelin, argent or braavos contract declared to starknet. This can be achieved
with `--class-hash` flag:

```shell
$ sncast \
    account create \
    --name some-name \
    --class-hash 0x00e2eb8f5672af4e6a4e8a8f1b44989685e668489b0a25437733756c5a34a1d6

Account successfully created. Prefund generated address with at least 432300000000 tokens. It is good to send more in the case of higher demand, max_fee * 2 = 864600000000
command: account create
max_fee: 0x64a7168300
address: 0x7a949e83b243068d0cbedd8d5b8b32fafea66c54de23c40e68b126b5c845b61

$ sncast \
  account deploy \
  --name some-name \
  --max-fee 864600000000

command: account deploy
transaction_hash: 0x20b20896ce63371ef015d66b4dd89bf18c5510a840b4a85a43a983caa6e2579
```

### Using Keystore and Starkli Account

Accounts created and deployed with [starkli](https://book.starkli.rs/accounts#accounts) can be used by specifying the [`--keystore` argument](../appendix/sncast/common.md#--keystore--k-path_to_keystore_file).

> ðŸ’¡ **Info**
> When passing the `--keystore` argument, `--account` argument must be a path to the starkli account JSON file.

```shell
$ sncast \
    --keystore path/to/keystore.json \
    --account path/to/account.json  \
    declare \
	--url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
    --contract-name my_contract
```

#### Importing an Account

To import an account into the file holding the accounts info (`~/.starknet_accounts/starknet_open_zeppelin_accounts.json` by default), use the `account add` command.

```shell
$ sncast \
    account add \
	--url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
    --name my_imported_account \
    --address 0x1 \
    --private-key 0x2 \
    --class-hash 0x3 \
    --type oz
```

For a detailed CLI description, see [account add command reference](../appendix/sncast/account/add.md).

### Creating an Account With Starkli-Style Keystore

It is possible to create an openzeppelin account with keystore in a similar way [starkli](https://book.starkli.rs/accounts#accounts) does.

```shell
$ sncast \
    --keystore my_key.json \
    --account my_account.json \
    account create
	--url http://127.0.0.1:5050 \
```

The command above will generate a keystore file containing the private key, as well as an account file containing the openzeppelin account info that can later be used with starkli.
