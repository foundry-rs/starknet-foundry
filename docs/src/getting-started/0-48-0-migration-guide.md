# `snforge` 0.48.0 Migration Guide

Starting from version 0.48.0, `snforge` will by default work only with Scarb versions 2.12 or newer.
This is due to the migration to the Scarb V2 version of procedural macros, which are used to handle arguments like `#[test]`
in `snforge`.
Thanks to this migration, tools like the Cairo plugin for VSCode will start showing better, more descriptive
errors.

To continue using `snforge` you will need to perform different actions depending on your Scarb version.

## Scarb Versions >= 2.12.0

For Scarb versions >= 2.12.0, we recommend upgrading your `snforge_std` dependency to the one matching your `snforge`
installation (0.48.0 at the time of writing this doc).

In your `Scarb.toml` file, update the dependency:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
snforge_std = "0.48.0"
```

No further action is required.

## Scarb Versions < 2.12.0

> 📝 **Note**
>
> We recommend upgrading to at least Scarb 2.12.0, as the steps outlined below will stop being supported soon.

For Scarb versions < 2.12.0 it is still possible to continue using the latest `snforge`.
We now publish a new package `snforge_std_deprecated`, supporting versions < 2.12.0.

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> `snforge_std_deprecated` may not provide full functionality in comparison to `snforge_std`.

First, in your `Scarb.toml`, remove the `snforge_std` dependency and add `snforge_std_deprecated`:

```diff
[dev-dependencies]
- snforge_std = "0.47.0"
+ snforge_std_deprecated = "0.48.0"
```

Next, replace all kinds of imports in your code from `snforge_std` to `snforge_std_deprecated`:

```diff
// Replace use statements
- use snforge_std::{ContractClassTrait, start_cheat_caller_address};
+ use snforge_std_deprecated::{ContractClassTrait, start_cheat_caller_address};

// Replace full path usages
- let result = snforge_std::declare("MyContract").unwrap();
+ let result = snforge_std_deprecated::declare("MyContract").unwrap();
```
