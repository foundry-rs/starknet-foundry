## Requirements

> 📝 **Note**
>
> Ensure all requirements are installed and follow the required minimal versions.
> Starknet Foundry will not run if not following these requirements.

To use Starknet Foundry, you need:

- [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html) version >= 2.8.5
- [Universal-Sierra-Compiler](https://github.com/software-mansion/universal-sierra-compiler)
- _(Optional for Scarb >= 2.10.0)_[^note] [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) version >= 1.80.1

all installed and added to your `PATH` environment variable.

[^note]: Additionally, your platform must be one of the supported:
* `aarch64-apple-darwin`
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `x86_64-apple-darwin`
* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

> 📝 **Note**
>
> `Universal-Sierra-Compiler` will be automatically installed if you use `asdf` or `snfoundryup`.
> You can also create `UNIVERSAL_SIERRA_COMPILER` env var to make it visible for `snforge`.

## Linux and macOS

> ℹ️ **Info**
>
> If you already have installed Rust, Scarb and asdf simply run
> `asdf plugin add starknet-foundry`

### Install asdf

Follow the instructions from [asdf docs](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#getting-started).

To verify that asdf was installed, run

```shell
asdf --version
```

### Install Scarb version >= 2.8.5

First, add Scarb plugin to asdf

```shell
asdf plugin add scarb
```

Install Scarb

```shell
asdf install scarb latest
```

Set a version globally (in your ~/.tool-versions file):

```shell
asdf set --home scarb latest
```

To verify that Scarb was installed, run

```shell
scarb --version
```

and verify that version is >= 2.8.5

### (Optional for Scarb >= 2.10.0)[^note] Rust Installation

> ℹ️️ **Info**
>
> Rust installation is only required if **ANY** of the following is true:
>
> * You are using Scarb version <= 2.10.0
> * Your platform is not one of the following supported platforms:
>   * `aarch64-apple-darwin`
>   * `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
>   * `x86_64-apple-darwin`
>   * `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

To verify that correct Rust version was installed, run

```shell
rustc --version
```

and verify that version is >= 1.80.1

See [Rust docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installation) for more details.

### Install Starknet Foundry

First, add Starknet Foundry plugin to asdf

```shell
asdf plugin add starknet-foundry
```

Install Starknet Foundry

```shell
asdf install starknet-foundry latest
```

Set a version globally (in your ~/.tool-versions file):

```shell
asdf set --home starknet-foundry latest
```

To verify that Starknet Foundry was installed, run

```shell
snforge --version
```

or

```shell
sncast --version
```

## Windows

> 🐧 **Info** - WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
>
> Starknet Foundry can be installed on Windows using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
>
> Please follow the [Linux and macOS](#linux-and-macos) guide within your WSL environment.

## Common Errors

### No Version Set

Users may encounter this error when trying to use `snforge` or `sncast` without setting a version:

```shell
No version is set for command snforge
Consider adding one of the following versions in your config file at $HOME/.tool_versions
starknet-foundry 0.37.0
```

This error indicates that `Starknet Foundry` version is unset. To resolve it, set the version globally using asdf:

```shell
asdf set --home starknet-foundry latest
```

For additional information on asdf version management, see
the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_6-set-a-version)

### Invalid Rust Version

When running any `snforge` command, error similar to this is displayed

```shell
Compiling snforge_scarb_plugin v0.34.0
error: package snforge_scarb_plugin v0.34.0 cannot be built because it requires rustc 1.80.1 or newer, while the currently active rustc version is 1.76.0
```

This indicates incorrect Rust version is installed or set.

Verify if rust version >= 1.80.1 is installed

```shell
rustc --version
1.80.1
```

To fix, follow the platform specific instructions:

If the version is incorrect or the error persists, try changing the global version of Rust

```shell
rustup default stable
```

and local version of Rust

```shell
rustup override set stable
```

### `scarb test` Isn’t Running `snforge`

By default, `scarb test` doesn't use `snforge` to run tests, and it needs to be configured.
Make sure to include this section in `Scarb.toml`

```toml
[scripts]
test = "snforge test"
```

## Set up shell completions (optional)

Shell completions allow your terminal to suggest and automatically complete commands and options when you press `Tab`.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Bash</strong></summary>

Add the following to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` (macOS):

```bash
# BEGIN FOUNDRY COMPLETIONS
_snforge() {
  if ! snforge completions bash >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    return 0
  fi
  source <(snforge completions bash)
  _snforge "$@"
}

_sncast() {
  if ! sncast completions bash >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    return 0
  fi
  source <(sncast completions bash)
  _sncast "$@"
}

complete -o default -F _snforge snforge
complete -o default -F _sncast sncast
# END FOUNDRY COMPLETIONS
```

Run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.bash_profile`), or open a new terminal session to apply the changes.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>ZSH</strong></summary>

Add the following to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# BEGIN FOUNDRY COMPLETIONS
_snforge() {
  if ! snforge completions zsh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    return 0
  fi
  eval "$(snforge completions zsh)"
  _snforge "$@"
}

_sncast() {
  if ! sncast completions zsh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    return 0
  fi
  eval "$(sncast completions zsh)"
  _sncast "$@"
}

autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
compdef _snforge snforge
compdef _sncast sncast
# END FOUNDRY COMPLETIONS
```

> 📝 **Note**
>
> If you already have `autoload -Uz compinit && compinit` in your `~/.zshrc` (for example, from another completions such as `scarb`), do not add it again. Only one call is needed.

Run `source ~/.zshrc`, or open a new terminal session to apply the changes.

For more information about Zsh completions, see the [Zsh documentation](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html) or the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zsh#Command_completion).

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Fish</strong></summary>

Add the following to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```bash
# BEGIN FOUNDRY COMPLETIONS
function _snforge
  if not snforge completions fish >/dev/null 2>&1
    return 0
  end
  source (snforge completions fish | psub)
  complete -C (commandline -cp)
end

function _sncast
  if not sncast completions fish >/dev/null 2>&1
    return 0
  end
  source (sncast completions fish | psub)
  complete -C (commandline -cp)
end

complete -c snforge -f -a '(_snforge)'
complete -c sncast -f -a '(_sncast)'
# END FOUNDRY COMPLETIONS
```

Run `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish`, or open a new terminal session to apply the changes.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Elvish</strong></summary>

Add the following to your `~/.config/elvish/rc.elv` file:

```bash
# BEGIN FOUNDRY COMPLETIONS
try {
  eval (snforge completions elvish | slurp)
} catch { return }

try {
  eval (sncast completions elvish | slurp)
} catch { return }
# END FOUNDRY COMPLETIONS
```

Run `eval (slurp <  ~/.config/elvish/rc.elv)`, or open a new terminal session to apply the changes.

</details>

## Universal-Sierra-Compiler update

If you would like to bump the USC manually (e.g. when the new Sierra version is released) you can do it by running:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/software-mansion/universal-sierra-compiler/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

## How to build Starknet Foundry from source code

If you are unable to install Starknet Foundry using the instructions above, you can try building it from
the [source code](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry) as follows:

1. [Set up a development environment.](../development/environment-setup.md)
2. Run `cd starknet-foundry && cargo build --release`. This will create a `target` directory.
3. Move the `target` directory to the desired location (e.g. `~/.starknet-foundry`).
4. Add `DESIRED_LOCATION/target/release/` to your `PATH`.

# Uninstallation

## Remove the Starknet Foundry Plugin

Follow the official asdf documentation to remove the Starknet Foundry plugin:

```bash
asdf plugin remove starknet-foundry
```

For more details, refer to the [asdf plugin documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/plugins.html#remove).

## Verify Uninstallation

To confirm Starknet Foundry has been completely removed, run:

```bash
snforge --version
```

If the uninstallation was successful, you should see `command not found: snforge`
