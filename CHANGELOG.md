# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Cast

#### Changed

- Short option for `--accounts-file` flag has been removed.
- Short option for `--contract-address` is now `-d` instead of `-a`.
- `account add` is renamed to `account import`.
- `account import` can be now used without specifying `--private-key` or `--private-key-file` flags. Instead private key will be read interactively from the user.

#### Fixed
- `account delete` command: It is no longer necessary to provide the `--url` argument each time. Either the `--url` or `--network` argument must be provided, but not both, as they are mutually exclusive.

### Forge

#### Changed

- When using test name filter with `--exact` flag, forge will try to compile only the selected test.

## [0.31.0] - 2024-09-26

### Cast

#### Changed

- `declare` and `verify` commands now use the Scarb `release` profile instead of the `dev` profile as the default for building artifacts
- StarkScan links now point to specific pages for transactions, contracts and classes.

#### Fixed

- Explorer links displayed upon committing transactions are now properly formatted
- `sncast declare` no longer fails for flat contracts (i.e. CASM artifacts with `bytecode_segment_lengths` being a number)

### Forge

#### Added

- Project generated by `snforge` contains `assert_macros` dependency with version 0.1.0 for Scarb <= 2.8.0, otherwise equal to Scarb
- Support for overriding fork configuration in test attribute with a different block ID, tag, or hash.
- `--no-optimization` flag that can be used to build contracts using the [starknet contract target](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/extensions/starknet/contract-target.html#starknet-contract-target. This is the default behavior when using Scarb < 2.8.3

#### Changed

- For Scarb >= `2.8.3` contract artifacts are built as part of the test target now. This process speeds up the compilation time, but the behavior of the contracts potentially may not be 100% consistent with the real networks. It can be disabled using the [--no-optimization flag](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/appendix/snforge/test.html#--no-optimization)
- `snforge` now validates if your project is setup to generate debug info needed for `cairo-coverage` when running  `--coverage` flag

### `snforge_scarb_plugin`

#### Fixed

- The package is now correctly versioned

## [0.30.0] - 2024-09-04

### Forge

#### Added

- Derived `Debug` and `Clone` on `trace.cairo` items
- `--coverage` flag to the `test` command. Saves trace data and then generates coverage report of test cases which pass and are not fuzz tests. You need [cairo-coverage](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-coverage) installed on your system.

#### Fixed

- `latest` fork block id tag validation in `Scarb.toml` is now consistent
- `RangeCheck96`,  `AddMod`, `MulMod` builtins are now properly supported
- Fixed escaping `'` in `#[should_panic]`s
- Fixed `scarb init` with snforge runner

## [0.29.0] - 2024-08-28

### Forge

#### Added

- Support for Scarb features in `snforge test` - flags the same as in Scarb. Read more [here](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/reference/conditional-compilation.html#features)

#### Fixed

- `snforge init` no longer emits warnings
- Project template generated by `snforge init` matches new `declare` cheatcode interface and compiles properly

## [0.28.0] - 2024-08-21

### Forge

#### Changed

- Bumped Cairo version to `2.7.0`
- Max steps in tests (configured by argument `--max-n-steps`) now defaults to 10 million
if not provided (changed from 4 million).

### Cast

#### Added
- Commands that commit transactions now display links to block explorers. When in human-readable mode, `invoke`, `declare`, `deploy`, `multicall run`, `account create` and `account deploy` will display additional information with an url. A new key in Cast configuration - `block-explorer` determines which block explorer service the displayed link leads to. Possible options are:` StarkScan`, `Voyager`, `ViewBlock`, `OkLink`, `NftScan`.

#### Changed
- `account create` outputs hint about the type of the tokens required to prefund a newly created account with before deployment

- `sncast` no longer expects `--url` as a common argument. It is now required specifically by commands that utilise it, i.e. `account add`, `account create`, `account delete`, `account deploy`, `multicall run`, `script run`, `call`, `declare`, `deploy`, `invoke`, `show-config`, `tx-status`.
Commands that do not require `--url` anymore: `account list`, `multicall new`, `script init`, `verify`

### Forge

#### Changed
- Fork tests now discover chain ID via provided RPC URL, defaulting to `SN_SEPOLIA`
- `#[fork]` attribute parameters format. [Read more here](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/snforge-advanced-features/fork-testing.html)
- steps counting
- Block tag changed name from `Latest`  to `latest`

#### Added

- `spy_messages_to_l1()` for listening in on messages to L1 sent by your contracts. [Read more here](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/testing/testing-messages-to-l1.html).

#### Changed

- Renamed global cheatcodes listed [here](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/appendix/cheatcodes.html) - cheatcode invocations affecting the global scope and working indefinitely, already marked with a `_global` suffix, received a `start_` prefix

### Cast

#### Added

- `verify` subcommand to verify contract (walnut APIs supported as of this version). [Read more here](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/appendix/sncast/verify.html)

- `event_name_hash` removal, in favour of `selector!` usage

#### Changed

- the tool now always compiles Sierra contract artifacts to CASM using
[`USC`](https://github.com/software-mansion/universal-sierra-compiler) - before it used to consume CASM artifacts
produced by Scarb if they were present. Setting up `casm = true` in `Scarb.toml` is no longer recommended - it may slow
down the compilation.
- The `replace_bytecode` cheatcode now returns `Result` with a possible `ReplaceBytecodeError`, since it may cause unexpected errors down the line when not handled properly

### Cast

#### Changed

- the tool now always compiles Sierra contract artifacts to CASM using
[`USC`](https://github.com/software-mansion/universal-sierra-compiler) - before it used to consume CASM artifacts
